\subsection*{Introduction}

In the simplest of terms, our project is making video driver for composite
video. But what differentiates us from other video drivers is that we plan on 
implementing a majority hardware solution. When this project was first 
brought up, we knew whatever project we choice had to meet our own personal
requirements. It had to be challenging, useful, and have a hardware and 
software component. Although this already exists in the market they can be over
priced. We plan on trying to make the same product for cheaper.
