\subsubsection*{Parts List}

To be able to complete this project we will need more hardware that what we 
currently have. We have a MSP430 microcontroller, the FPGA board, and a mini
black and white TV. We will need to use the 50 dollar funding from BCIT to order
(Matt I dont remeber what you said we needed). If our project is successful we 
will need to find a colour television (Most likly find for free somewhere).
